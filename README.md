**Features:**
- Loads step definitions from `/data/sample_steps.json`

- Modular JS structure (main hub, JSON parser, unit test)
- Intended for local prototyping, Glitch deployment, and student experimentation

**Setup:**

2. Browse to the main page and see a specimen loader/preview.
3. Edit `/data/sample_steps.json` to add or revise steps.

**Editing Content:**
- Steps JSON and 3D assets can be freely modified for prototyping.
